# Helper App for Mega Civilization

This is a helper app for the board games Mega Civilization, Western Empires and Eastern Empires.

It helps you track which civilization advances you already bought and
what color bonuses you have accumulated when you buy the next time. The cost mentioned in
the buy screen already has the best bonus subtracted from the original price.
Supports cards with special buying bonuses like Anatomy, Library, Monument and Written Records.

The start screen acts as a dashboard and tracks the current color bonuses, victory points
and calamity effects you have because of the civilization advances you already bought.
